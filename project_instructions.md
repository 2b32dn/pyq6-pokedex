# PyQt6 Final Project - Application Development

## Project Overview

For your final project, you will design and implement a complete desktop application using Python and PyQt6. This
project demonstrates your mastery of GUI development concepts covered throughout the course and gives you creative
freedom to build something meaningful and interesting.

**Team Size:** 1-2 students  
**Language:** Python with PyQt6  
**Database:** Not required (focus on GUI concepts)

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:

- Design and implement user-friendly graphical interfaces
- Apply various PyQt6 widgets and layout managers effectively
- Implement signal-slot mechanisms, including custom signals
- Create professional applications with menus, actions, and keyboard shortcuts
- Structure and organize larger GUI applications
- Present and explain your technical work clearly

## Technical Requirements

Your application **must** include all the following components:

### 1. User Interface Design

- **Multiple Windows/Dialogs:** At least one main window and one additional dialog or secondary window
- **Widget Variety:** Use at least 6 different types of widgets (e.g., QPushButton, QLineEdit, QLabel, QComboBox,
  QListWidget, QTableWidget, QTextEdit, QProgressBar, QSlider, etc.)
- **Layout Management:** Demonstrate proper use of at least 3 different layout managers (QVBoxLayout, QHBoxLayout,
  QGridLayout, QFormLayout, etc.)

### 2. Event Handling and Signals

- **Built-in Signals:** Connect and handle signals from various widgets
- **Custom Signals:** Create at least one custom widget that emits custom signals
- **Signal-Slot Connections:** Show both automatic connections and manual signal-slot connections

### 3. Menus and Actions

- **Menu Bar:** Implement a complete menu system with at least 3 menus
- **Actions:** Create QAction objects for menu items and toolbar buttons
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implement keyboard shortcuts for key functionality
- **Toolbar:** Optional but recommended - add a toolbar with common actions

### 4. Application Features

- **Data Management:** Handle and manipulate data within the application (using Python data structures - lists,
  dictionaries, etc.)
- **File Operations:** Implement at least basic file I/O (save/load functionality)
- **Input Validation:** Include proper validation for user inputs
- **Error Handling:** Implement appropriate error handling and user feedback

### 5. Code Quality

- **Organization:** Well-structured code with appropriate use of classes and functions
- **Documentation:** Include docstrings and comments explaining key functionality
- **Naming:** Use clear, descriptive variable and function names

## Suggested Project Topics

- **Budget Tracker:** Manage income/expenses with categories and visual summaries

### 2. **Educational Tools**

- **Flashcard Application:** Create study sets, quiz modes, and progress tracking
- **Quiz Generator:** Create custom quizzes with different question types and scoring
- **Grade Calculator:** Input assignments and calculate final grades with different weighting schemes
- **Vocabulary Builder:** Manage word lists with definitions, examples, and practice modes

### 3. **Games and Entertainment**

- **Puzzle Games:** Sudoku, word puzzles, or logic games with different difficulty levels
- **Card Games:** Solitaire, memory games, or simple card-based games
- **Trivia Game:** Multiple-choice questions with categories and scoring

### 4. **Utility Applications**

- **File Organizer:** Tool to organize files by type, date, or custom rules
- **Unit Converter:** Convert between different units with multiple categories

### 5. **Data Visualization and Analysis**

- **Chart Creator:** Create different types of charts from user data input
- **Log File Analyzer:** Parse and display information from text-based log files
- **Survey Tool:** Create simple surveys and display results graphically
- **Inventory Manager:** Track items with quantities, locations, and basic reporting

### 6. **Specialized Tools**

- **Recipe Manager:** Store recipes with ingredients, instructions, and meal planning
- **Music Library Organizer:** Manage music collections with metadata and playlists
- **Photo Gallery:** Browse and organize photos with basic editing features
- **Contact Manager:** Store and organize contact information with search and grouping

## Submission Requirements

Create a single git repository on GitHub for both submissions. Put all your files in that git repository. Share it
with the user `profdenis`.

### Submission 1: Project Proposal and UI Design (20% of course grade)

**Due Date:** June 13 (before midnight)

1. **Project Description Document (2-3 pages):**

   - Project title and team members
   - Detailed description of your application's purpose and target users
   - List of planned features and functionality
   - Explanation of how your project will meet all technical requirements
   - Timeline and task distribution (for teams)

2. **UI Design/Prototype:**
   Choose one of the following approaches:

   - **Qt Designer Files:** Create .ui files showing the main interface layouts
   - **Wireframes:** Hand-drawn or digital wireframes showing interface design
   - **Mockups:** Digital mockups created with any design tool

3. **Technical Architecture:**
   - Brief overview of planned classes and modules
   - Description of custom signals you plan to implement
   - Menu structure and keyboard shortcuts plan

### Submission 2: Final Implementation (30% of course grade)

**Due Date:** June 29 (before midnight)

1. **Complete Source Code:**

   - All Python files organized in appropriate directories
   - Requirements.txt file listing any additional dependencies
   - README.md with installation and running instructions

2. **Documentation:**

   - Updated project description reflecting any changes from proposal
   - User manual explaining how to use your application
   - Technical documentation explaining your code structure

   - Demonstrate all major features of your application
   - Explain interesting technical choices or challenges
   - Show code structure and highlight custom signals/widgets

## Academic Integrity

While you may work in teams of 2, each team must submit original work. You may use online resources for learning PyQt6
concepts, but your application must be your own design and implementation. Clearly cite any external libraries or
significant code snippets you use.
